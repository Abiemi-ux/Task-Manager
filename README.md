This is a code sample illustrating a RESTFUL API.

To test the API, I used Postman

1. To fetch all tasks I used the GET request in this URL
   http://localhost:5000/api/tasks
2. To add a new task I used the POST request in this URL
   http://localhost:5000/api/tasks
3. To update the task name and completion status I used the PUT request in this URL
   http://localhost:5000/api/tasks/1(1 here is the specific task ID)
4. To delete a task I used the DELETE request in this URL
   http://localhost:5000/api/tasks/1(1 here is the specific task ID)
